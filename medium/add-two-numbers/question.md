# Add Two Numbers

**Difficulty:** Medium

## Problem Description

You are given two non-empty linked lists, `l1` and `l2`, where each represents a non-negative integer.

The digits are stored in reverse order, e.g. the number 321 is represented as `1 -> 2 -> 3` in the linked list.

Each of the nodes contains a single digit. You may assume the two numbers do not contain any leading zero, except the number 0 itself.

Return the sum of the two numbers as a linked list.

## Examples

### Example 1:

**Input:** `l1 = [1,2,3]`, `l2 = [4,5,6]`

**Output:** `[5,7,9]`

**Explanation:** 321 + 654 = 975.

### Example 2:

**Input:** `l1 = [9]`, `l2 = [9]`

**Output:** `[8,1]`

## Constraints

- `1 <= l1.length, l2.length <= 100`
- `0 <= Node.val <= 9`
