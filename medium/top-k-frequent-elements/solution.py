ðŸ•’ Time Complexity:
- Counting frequencies: O(n)
- Bucketing values: O(n)
- Collecting top k elements: O(n) in worst case
â†’ Overall: O(n), where n is the length of the input list

ðŸ§  Space Complexity:
- Frequency map: O(n)
- Buckets: O(n)
- Result list: O(k)
â†’ Overall: O(n)

ðŸš€ Why Bucket Sort is Efficient Here:

- A naive approach would sort elements based on frequency â†’ O(n log n)
- But bucket sort leverages the fact that:
  - The maximum frequency of any number is at most `n`
  - So we can create an array of `n+1` buckets where index = frequency
- By inserting numbers into these buckets and iterating from high to low,
  we avoid sorting altogether, achieving **linear time performance (O(n))**

This makes the bucket sort method optimal for this problem compared to a sorting-based approach.
