"""
Time Complexity: O(n)
- We move the two pointers (left and right) inward at most n times combined.
- No nested iterations over the array, just linear traversal.

Space Complexity: O(1)
- We use only two pointer variables, regardless of input size.
- No additional space or data structures are used.
