# Time Complexity: O(n * log(max(piles))) where n is the number of piles
# - Binary search runs in O(log(max(piles))) iterations
# - Each iteration calculates hours for all piles in O(n) time

# Space Complexity: O(1)
# - Only using constant extra space for variables

# Algorithm: Binary search to find minimum eating speed
# 1. Set search range from 1 to max pile size
# 2. For each candidate speed, calculate total hours needed
# 3. If feasible (â‰¤ h hours), try slower speed; otherwise try faster speed
# 4. Return the minimum feasible speed found
