"""
Time Complexity Analysis:
- O(n log n) due to sorting the position-speed pairs by position
- The subsequent loop through sorted pairs is O(n)
- Overall: O(n log n)

Space Complexity Analysis:
- O(n) for storing the position_speed_pairs list
- O(n) for the fleet_times stack in worst case (when no cars form fleets)
- Overall: O(n)

Algorithm Explanation:
1. Sort cars by position (closest to target first)
2. For each car, calculate time to reach target
3. If a car behind takes â‰¤ time than car ahead, they form a fleet
4. Use stack to track distinct fleet times - merge fleets by removing faster times
5. Final stack size = number of car fleets
