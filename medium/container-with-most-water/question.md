# Container With Most Water

## Problem

You are given an integer array `height` where `height[i]` represents the height of the i-th bar.

You may choose any two bars to form a container. Return the **maximum amount of water a container can store**.

---

## Example 1:

**Input:**  
`height = [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]`  
**Output:**  
`49`

## Example 2:

**Input:**  
`height = [2, 2, 2]`  
**Output:**  
`4`

---

## Constraints

- 2 <= height.length <= 1000  
- 0 <= height[i] <= 1000

---

## Recommended Time & Space Complexity

You should aim for a solution with:

- **Time Complexity:** O(n)  
- **Space Complexity:** O(1)
