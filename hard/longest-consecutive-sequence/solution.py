"""
ðŸ§  Time Complexity: O(n)
- Each number is added to a set â†’ O(n)
- Each number is removed from the set at most once
- No number is reprocessed, and lookups/removals are O(1)

ðŸ“¦ Space Complexity: O(n)
- The set stores all unique numbers from input

ðŸš€ Why is this better than sorting?
- A sorting-based approach would take O(n log n) time.
- This avoids sorting altogether and uses hash-based set operations,
  achieving true linear time in the average and worst case.

âœ… This is an efficient O(n) approach using a hash set and deletion to avoid reprocessing.
