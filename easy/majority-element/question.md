# Majority Element

## Problem Description

Given an array `nums` of size `n`, return the **majority element**.

The majority element is the element that appears more than ⌊n / 2⌋ times in the array.  
You may assume that the majority element **always exists** in the array.

## Examples

### Example 1:
**Input:**  
`nums = [5,5,1,1,1,5,5]`  
**Output:**  
`5`

---

### Example 2:
**Input:**  
`nums = [2,2,2]`  
**Output:**  
`2`

---

## Constraints

- `1 <= nums.length <= 50,000`
- `-1,000,000,000 <= nums[i] <= 1,000,000,000`

---

## Follow-up

Can you solve the problem in **linear time** and **O(1)** space?
