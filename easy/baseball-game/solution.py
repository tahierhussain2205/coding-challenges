"""
Complexity Analysis:

Time Complexity: O(n)
- We iterate through each operation exactly once
- Each operation (append, pop, sum calculation) takes O(1) time
- Final sum calculation takes O(k) where k is the number of remaining scores
- Since k â‰¤ n, overall time complexity is O(n)

Space Complexity: O(n)
- In the worst case, we might store all n operations as scores in our stack
- This happens when there are no 'C' operations to remove scores
- The score_record list can grow up to size n in the worst case

Algorithm Explanation:
1. Use a stack (list) to maintain the current valid scores
2. Process each operation sequentially:
   - For integers: Convert to int and push to stack
   - For '+': Sum last two scores and push result
   - For 'D': Double last score and push result  
   - For 'C': Remove/pop the last score
3. Return sum of all remaining scores in the stack

Key Insights:
- Stack is perfect for this problem since we only need to access recent scores
- By storing actual integer values instead of strings, we avoid repeated conversions
- The problem guarantees all operations are valid, so no error checking needed
