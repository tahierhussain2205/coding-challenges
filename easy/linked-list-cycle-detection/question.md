# Linked List Cycle Detection

**Difficulty:** Easy

## Problem Description

Given the beginning of a linked list `head`, return `true` if there is a cycle in the linked list. Otherwise, return `false`.

There is a cycle in a linked list if at least one node in the list can be visited again by following the next pointer.

Internally, `index` determines the index of the beginning of the cycle, if it exists. The tail node of the list will set it's next pointer to the index-th node. If `index = -1`, then the tail node points to null and no cycle exists.

**Note:** `index` is not given to you as a parameter.

## Examples

### Example 1:

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4], index = 1
Output: true
```

**Explanation:** There is a cycle in the linked list, where the tail connects to the 1st node (0-indexed).

### Example 2:

```
Input: head = [1,2], index = -1
Output: false
```

## Constraints

- `1 <= Length of the list <= 1000`
- `-1000 <= Node.val <= 1000`
- `index` is `-1` or a valid index in the linked list
